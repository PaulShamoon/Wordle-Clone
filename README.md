# Wordle-Clone



A fun clone of the popular word game Wordle.  

You have 6 tries to guess the randomly selected 5 letter word. After each guess that you make, the letters will light up in various colors. Green means the letter is in the word and in the correct spot; yellow means it is in the word but not in the correct spot; gray means the letter is not in the word.    

This project is made using Python and the Pygame library. The words are randomly selected from a file of 10,000 of the most popular words in the English language according to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
